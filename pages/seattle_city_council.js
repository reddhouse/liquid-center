      <p><FirstWord>Liquid</FirstWord> democracy is a new way for City Councilmembers to align themselves with the interests of Seattle residents 100% of the time, on 100% of the issues.</p>

      <p>Instead of Councilmembers each going about their own methods of addressing challenges in their districts, <b>liquid democracy encourages the public to set the legislative agenda of the City Council, and decide which individual Council Bills should become law.</b></p>

      <Section>Hereâ€™s how it works:</Section>

      <Indented>
        <p><b>-</b> Voters elect a new, liquid Councilmember, or ask their current Councilmember to convert to a liquid democracy platform such as Liquid Center.</p>

        <p><b>-</b> Voters download an app, such as <a href="https://liquify.us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Liquify</a>, to make their preferences known to their Councilmember, and to collectively determine what problems the City Council should be focused on fixing (in order of priority).</p>

        <p><b>-</b> Councilmembers use a version of the same app to tally votes from constituents in their district. When voters indicate YES on a particular bill/initiative, their Councilmember will vote YES in Council, to turn it into law.</p>

        <p><b>-</b> Voters can delegate their votes to any other citizen of their choosing when they are too busy, uninterested, or uninformed about a particular policy issue.</p>
      </Indented>

      <p>The effects of implementing this type of representation in City Council are profound and immediate. Councilmembers no longer have to play the role of superhero (or super-villain), as all parties become aware of exactly where a quantifiable number/percentage of citizens stands on every issue.</p>
